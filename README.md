Dear Hiring Manager,  

I hope you're doing well.  

I wanted to let you know that Iâ€™ve completed the backend assignment for the position of Back End Trainee. Even though the assignment suggested using Flask, Django, I decided to work with the MERN stack instead. 
### I did this project all on my own, without any help from others or using the internet, which shows my ability to tackle challenges independently.  

I'm really excited about the opportunity to work with WaterDip Labs. I believe that I can be a great addition to your team because I'm a fast learner and eager to contribute.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the chance to talk more about how I can help your team.  

Best regards,  

Manan Kumar
